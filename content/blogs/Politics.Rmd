 Global warming and political views (GSS)

[A 2010 Pew Research poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/10/27/wide-partisan-divide-over-global-warming/) asked 1,306 Americans, "From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"


In this exercise we analyze whether there are any differences between the proportion of people who believe the earth is getting warmer and their political ideology. As usual, from the **survey sample data**, we will use the proportions to estimate values of *population parameters*. The file has 2253 observations on the following 2 variables:

- `party_or_ideology`: a factor (categorical) variable with levels Conservative Republican, Liberal Democrat, Mod/Cons Democrat, Mod/Lib Republican
- `response` : whether the respondent believes the earth is warming or not, or Don't know/ refuse to answer

```{r, read_global_warming_pew_data}
global_warming_pew <- read_csv(here::here("data", "global_warming_pew.csv"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".

We will be constructing three 95% confidence intervals to estimate population parameters, for the % who believe that **Earth is warming**, accoridng to their party or ideology. You can create the CIs using the formulas by hand, or use `prop.test()`-- just rememebr to exclude the Dont know / refuse to answer!

```{r}
#We have a binomial variable here, [0,1] for [Earth warming & Not warming]
binglob <- global_warming_pew %>% 
  #Calculate the relevant inputs
  count(party_or_ideology, response) %>% 
  #Disregard people who did not say anything
  filter(response!="Don't know / refuse to answer") %>% 
  #Calculate the total observations
  mutate(sum_n=sum(n))
binglob
```

```{r}
binglob <- binglob %>% 
  #Filter only those we are interested in
  filter(response=="Earth is warming") %>% 
  #For each party or ideology
  group_by(party_or_ideology) %>% 
  #Calculate upper and lower confidence intervals
  mutate(confint_low=prop.test(n,sum_n,conf.level=0.95)$conf.int[1],confint_upp=prop.test(n,sum_n,conf.level=0.95)$conf.int[2])
binglob
```


Does it appear that whether or not a respondent believes the earth is warming is independent of their party ideology? You may want to

# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv')

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist$modeldate <- mdy(approval_polllist$modeldate)
approval_polllist$startdate <- mdy(approval_polllist$startdate)
approval_polllist$enddate <- mdy(approval_polllist$enddate)

glimpse(approval_polllist)

```


```{r lubridate and plot}

approval_polllist2 <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate (year = lubridate::year(enddate),
          month = lubridate::month(enddate, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(enddate))
```
## Create a plot

```{r lubridate and plot2}

plotter <- approval_polllist2 %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarize(avg_app=approve-disapprove) %>% 
 summarise(
    mean_avg_app = mean(avg_app),
    sd_avg_app = sd(avg_app),
    count = n(),
    #Here calculate standard error SD/sqrt(n)
    se_avg_app = sd_avg_app/ sqrt(count),
    #Then calculate the t score
    t_critical = qt(0.95, count - 1 ),
    #Calculate 95 prct
    lower = mean_avg_app - t_critical * se_avg_app,
    upper = mean_avg_app + t_critical * se_avg_app
  ) 
```
```{r lubridate_and_plot3,out.width="100%}

ggplot(plotter, aes(x=week,y=mean_avg_app))+
  #Add the confidence interval
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=lower,ymax=upper),fill="grey70",alpha=0.2,color="orange")+
  #Add the scatters
  geom_point(color="orange")+
  #Draw a line between scatters
  geom_line(color="orange")+
  #Add blue line
  geom_smooth(se=F)+
  #Draw the horizontal line
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="orange",size=2)+
  #Theme & titles
  theme_light()+
  labs(title="Estimating Approval Margin (Approve-Disapprove) for Joe Biden", subtitle="Weekly Average of All Polls",y="Average Approval Margin (Approve-Disapprove)",x="Week of the Year")

```

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 3` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

Week 3 has the highest confidence interval and week 25 has the lowest confidence interval. The change means that the confidence interval decreased during the time, which means that the sampling error became smaller, since the statistical rejection of the null hypothesis had a higher reliability and be more confident, the higher the accuracy in turn.
