We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

In creating your plots, you may find these links useful:

- https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_ribbon.html
- https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_tile.html 
- https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_rug.html

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

```{r expected rentals,out.width="100%"}
#Calculate expected rentals and merge datasets

  filter(year %in% c("2016","2017","2018","2019")) %>%

bike2 <- bike %>%

    group_by(year,month) %>% 
    mutate(actual_rentals=mean(bikes_hired))
