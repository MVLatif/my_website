description: I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I first defined the aesthetics and reordered in order to show  Steven Spielberg on top. Additionally, I added the mean point, error bars and confidence interval overlap to show that indeed the two directors have an. The error bars represent the standard error from the mean and how variable my data is. They give a rough idea of either how precise a measurement is, or how far from the reported value it might be. In this graph the fact that the 95% confidence interval overlap indicates that both sample sizes of IMDB ratings are equal or nearly equal, and that the P value is greater than 0.05. Thus, the difference between the two is not statistically significant.
