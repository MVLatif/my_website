<p>I am half Italian, half Pakistani but I grew up in London. I completed my undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol and graduated in Modern Languages: Russian and Italian.</p>
<p>To list a few of my hobbies, I enjoy to travel and explore new places. During my year abroad at university I worked in Milan for six months and studied in St.Â Petersburg, Russia. The Russian culture in particular fascinates me and I have since travelled to other parts of Russia, including Moscow, Yaroslavl and Suzdal, three cities are included in the golden ring.</p>

<p>I enjoy reading non-fiction books in my spare time, particularly on current affairs. I highly enjoyed <em>freakonomics</em> which applies rational economic analysis to everyday situations and explains how the way we normally make decisions is often irrational. I also enjoyed <em>The Great Disruption</em> by Paul Gilding, an Australian environmentalist who discusses the environmental and economic crisis we face. I worked at a start-up which consults tourism companies on ways to reduce their environmental impact which is something that I am passionate about. During the summers, I work alongside The One Ocean Foundation to help with the protection of beaches.</p>
