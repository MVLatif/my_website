By plotting a histogram, scatterplot and boxplot, I was able to visualise the data regarding gender, pay and experience. The objective of this task was to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

Based on the evidence below and from looking at the p values which lay outside the 95% confidence interval, we rejected the NULL hypothesis and kept the alternative hypothesis that being the true difference in means between group female and group male is not equal to 0. There is a significant difference between experience of the male and female executives with the former being 3 times larger. This means that on average men have a stonger affiliation with a positive experience and a higher salary.

We conducted a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience to see whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

From the scatterplot and correlation matrix, we can include that female tend to have high salary with less working experience, while male need to accumulate much higher salary to gain a little bit higher salary. Because from the figure, both the average salary and average experience of female are both smaller than the men's; and the gap between the average experience year that the men and women accumulated, is much smaller than the gap between the average salary that female and male earned.
```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```


The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
Gender_Data <- mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

Gender_Data %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  mutate(me=2*se) %>%
  mutate(ci=qnorm(0.95)*sd/se) %>%
  mutate(lower_bound=mean-1.96*ci) %>%
  mutate(upper_bound=mean+1.96*ci)
# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval


```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

The females have a higher SD meaning that there is more variation amongst their salaries. Since men have a higher SE of mean, that corresponds to men having a wider distribution. A higher margin of error for the men indicates that men's sample would vary more from the real population value than women. The CI indicates how we are 95% confident that the population parameter is between 64526 and 64559 for women and 73223 and 73255 for men.

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
ratings_in_null_world <- omega %>% 
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null="independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type="permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

ratings_in_null_world %>% visualize()

# hypothesis testing using infer package
```

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

```{r, experience_stats}

# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
Experience_Gender <- favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega) 
Experience_Gender %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  mutate(me=2*se) %>%
  mutate(ci=qnorm(0.95)*sd/se) %>%
  mutate(lower_bound=mean-1.96*ci) %>%
  mutate(upper_bound=mean+1.96*ci)

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
ratings_in_null_world2 <- omega %>% 
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null="independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type="permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female")) 
ratings_in_null_world2 %>% visualize()

```


## Relationship Salary - Experience ?
```{r, salary_exp_scatter}

ggplot(data=omega, aes(x=experience, y=salary))+
  geom_point()+
   geom_smooth(color="red", method = "lm")+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Relationship between salary and experience",
    x="experience",
    y="salary"
  )

```


## Check correlations between the data
```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```
