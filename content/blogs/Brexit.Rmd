```{r load-libraries, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)  # Load ggplot2, dplyr, and all the other tidyverse packages
library(gapminder)  # gapminder dataset

```

In order to understand the distribution of our data set we plotted a histogram, a density plot, and the empirical cumulative distribution function of the leave % in all constituencies. 

```{r brexit_histogram, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# This is to plot the histogram
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2.5) + labs(title = "Distribution of Brexit vote data",subtitle = "Spread of voting results in UK constituencies", x = "Percentage of leave vote",y = "Number of UK constituencies") +
  
  geom_density()+ labs(title = "Distribution of Brexit vote data",subtitle = "Smoothed spread of voting results in UK constituencies", x = "Percentage of leave vote",y = "Number of UK constituencies")


# This shows the cumulative distribution of the leave % 
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = leave_share)) +
  stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + labs(title = "Distribution of Brexit vote data",subtitle = "Cumulative distribution of voting results in UK constituencies", x = "Percentage of leave vote",y = "Cumulative frequency (%)")
  


```

To better understand the hypothesis that UK citizens feared immigration, we plotted a scatterplot to show the correlation between the proportion of native born residents (`born_in_uk`) in a constituency and its `leave_share`. 

```{r brexit_immigration_correlation}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = born_in_uk, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + labs(title = "Relationship between native born residents and leave votes",subtitle = "Scatter plot of leave votes and ethnicity from different UK constituencies", x = "Proportion of native born residents in a UK constituency",y = "Percentage of leave votes")+
  theme_bw() + 
  NULL
```

The graph shows a positive correlation. Furthermore, we added geom_smooth to add the best fit line for better visualisation of the trend.

```{r brexit_immigration_plot}
ggplot(brexit_results, aes(x = born_in_uk, y = leave_share)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  
  # add a smoothing line, and use method="lm" to get the best straight-line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + 
  
  # use a white background and frame the plot with a black box
  theme_bw() +
  NULL
```
