# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

> Answer: We are missing 1004 observations from weights column.

```{r, eda_on_weight}
yrbss %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=weight))+
  geom_histogram()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x="Weight",y="Count",title="Distribution of Weights")

```


```{r, summary statistics}
sprintf("%f is the number of missing values for weights",sum(is.na(yrbss$weight)))

yrbss %>% 
  #Get rid of NA values
  na.omit() %>% 
 summarise(
    min_weight =  min(weight),
    max_weight =  max(weight),
    median_weight =  median(weight),
    mean_weight = mean(weight),
    sd_weight = sd(weight),
    count = n()
  ) 
```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable in the dataframe `yrbss`, called `physical_3plus` , which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise. You may also want to calculate the number and % of those who are and are not active for more than 3 days. Use the `count()` function and see if you get the same results as `group_by()... summarise()`

  
```{r, mutate_and_count}

#Create physical_3plus label

tidied <- yrbss %>% 
  #Get rid of nas
  na.omit() %>% 
  #Create physical_3plus col, yes if activity is greater than 3, no if else.
  mutate(physical_3plus=ifelse(physically_active_7d<3,"no","yes"))

CI <- tidied %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarize(count=n()) %>% 
  #Calculate percentage
  mutate(percentage=count/sum(count))

CI

```

Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

```{r, 95% CI for prop}

CI %>% 
  mutate(total=sum(count)) %>% 
  filter(physical_3plus=="no") %>% 
  mutate(CI_low=prop.test(count,total,conf.level=0.95)$conf.int[1],CI_up=prop.test(count,total,conf.level=0.95)$conf.int[2])



```

Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}
tidied %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=weight,y=physical_3plus))+
  theme_economist()+
  labs(title="Relationship between physical activity and weight",x="Weight",y="Physical Activity")
```
> Answer: We expected a negative correlation between weight and physical activity. However, the boxplots do not show a clear-cut picture. Specifically, the median weight value of both physically active and non-active kids are really close to each other. The variation within 25% and 75%th percentiles also appears to be similar. However, there are more outliers for non-physically active category. It might also be the case that the reason for higher median weight for physically active kids is due to i)Overweight kids are encouraged to take more physical activity to lose weight; and ii)The difference in weight can be due to muscle mass. 

## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean, SD, etc. weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r, ci_using_formulas}

comparison <- tidied %>% 
  #For each group
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  #Calculate the mean weight and ignore na values, even though we got rid of them previously with na.omit()
  summarize(mean_weight=mean(weight))

comparison

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

```{r, t_test_using_R}
yrbss<-tidied
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```
## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r, calc_obs_difference}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```



Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r, hypothesis_testing_using_infer_package}

null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  # specify variables
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  
  # assume independence, i.e, there is no difference
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  
  # generate 1000 reps, of type "permute"
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  
  # calculate statistic of difference, namely "diff in means"
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. Then I ran a hypothesis test using both t.test and infer package to understand from a null distribution where I would assume zero difference between the two

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}
# Select Tim Burton and Steven Spielberg and filter for director and rating
rating_analysis <- movies %>% filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton") %>% select(director, rating) %>% group_by(director)

# Calculate summary statistics
summary_stat <- rating_analysis %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    mean_rating = mean(rating),
    sd_rating = sd(rating),
    count = n(),

    #Here calculate standard error SD/sqrt(n)
    se_rating = sd_rating/ sqrt(count),
    #Then calculate the t score
    t_critical = qt(0.95, df=4),
    #Calculate 95 prct
    lower = mean_rating - t_critical * se_rating,
    upper = mean_rating + t_critical * se_rating
  ) 
```

```{r}

# Create plot
summary_stat %>% 
  
  # Define aesthetics and reorder so that Steven Spielberh is shown on top
  ggplot(aes(x=mean_rating, y=reorder(director, mean_rating), xmin=lower,xmax=upper)) +
  
  # Add mean

  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin=lower,xmax=upper), color=c("orangered1", "turquoise4"), 
                size=1, width=0.1) +
  
  # Add labels to mean value
  geom_text(aes(label=round(mean_rating, digits=2)), size=5, vjust=-1.5)+
  
  # Add confidence interval overlap
  geom_rect(xmin=7.27, xmax= 7.33, ymin=-Inf, ymax=+Inf, alpha=0.2, fill="grey") +
  
  # Define Theme

  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?", 
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",
       x="Mean IMDB Rating", y="Director")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```

```{r}

# Omega Group plc- Pay Discrimination


At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

You are asked to carry out the analysis. The objective is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))
glimpse(omega) # examine the data frame
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that you can perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


Calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, you show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
Gender_Data <- mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

Gender_Data %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  mutate(me=2*se) %>%
  mutate(ci=qnorm(0.95)*sd/se) %>%
  mutate(lower_bound=mean-1.96*ci) %>%
  mutate(upper_bound=mean+1.96*ci)
# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
# the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, 
# and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval


```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

The females have a higher SD meaning that there is more variation amongst their salaries. Since men have a higher SE of mean, that corresponds to men having a wider distribution. A higher margin of error for the men indicates that men's sample would vary more from the real population value than women. The CI indicates how we are 95% confident that the population parameter is between 64526 and 64559 for women and 73223 and 73255 for men.

You can also run a hypothesis testing, assuming as a null hypothesis that the mean difference in salaries is zero, or that, on average, men and women make the same amount of money. You should tun your hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing}

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
ratings_in_null_world <- omega %>% 
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null="independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type="permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

ratings_in_null_world %>% visualize()

# hypothesis testing using infer package
```

> What can you conclude from your analysis? A couple of sentences would be enough

Given that the p value is outside the 95% confidence interval and so we reject NULL hypothesis and keep the alternative hypothesis that being the true difference in means between group female and group male is not equal to 0.

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}

# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
Experience_Gender <- favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega) 
Experience_Gender %>%
  mutate(se=sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  mutate(me=2*se) %>%
  mutate(ci=qnorm(0.95)*sd/se) %>%
  mutate(lower_bound=mean-1.96*ci) %>%
  mutate(upper_bound=mean+1.96*ci)

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data = omega)

# hypothesis testing using infer package
ratings_in_null_world2 <- omega %>% 
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null="independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type="permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female")) 
ratings_in_null_world2 %>% visualize()

```

Based on this evidence, can you conclude that there is a significant difference between the experience of the male and female executives? Perform similar analyses as in the previous section. Does your conclusion validate or endanger your conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries?  

Given that the p value is outside the 95% confidence interval and so we reject NULL hypothesis and keep the alternative hypothesis that being the true difference in means between group female and group male is not equal to 0. There is a significant difference between experience of the male and female executives with the former being 3 times larger. This means that on average men have a stonger affiliation with a positive experience and a higher salary.

## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

Analyse the relationship between salary and experience. Draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}

ggplot(data=omega, aes(x=experience, y=salary))+
  geom_point()+
   geom_smooth(color="red", method = "lm")+
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Relationship between salary and experience",
    x="experience",
    y="salary"
  )

```


## Check correlations between the data
You can use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to colour by `gender` and make ths plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}
omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()
```

> Look at the salary vs experience scatterplot. What can you infer from this plot? Explain in a couple of sentences

So we can include that female tend to have high salary with less working experience, while male need to accumulate much higher salary to gain a little bit higher salary. Because from the figure, both the average salary and average experience of female are both smaller than the men's; and the gap between the average experience year that the men and women accumulated, is much smaller than the gap between the average salary that female and male earned.


# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!


## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r yield_curve_1,fig.width=20, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
yield_curve %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=value,color=duration)) +
  facet_wrap(~duration,scales="free",nr=5)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position="none")+
  labs(title="Yields on U.S Treasury rates since 1960",x="",y="%",caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")
```
### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r yield_curve_2,fig.width=20, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
yield_curve_dates <- yield_curve %>% 
  mutate (year = year(date),
          month = lubridate::month(date, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(date)) %>% 
  filter(year >1998) 
  

yield_curve_dates %>%
  #Force ggplot to use levels as factor
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(maturity,levels=unique(yield_curve_dates$maturity)),
             y=value,
             #Group by month to make R understand that we are connecting values of each duration by month
             group=month,color=as.factor(year)))+
  #Add the geometric line
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~year,nr=6)+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(title="US Yield Curve",
       x="Maturity",y="Yield(%)",caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  theme(legend.position="none")

```


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```


```{r yield_curve_3,fig.width=20, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
yield_curve_3_10 <- yield_curve_dates %>% 
  filter(maturity %in% c("3m","10y")) 

yield_curve_3_10 %>% 
  #Color based on factor, rather than alphabetically
  ggplot(aes(x=date,y=value,color=factor(duration,levels=unique(yield_curve_3_10$duration))))+
  #Add the lines
  geom_line()+
  #Theme and labels
  theme_bw()+
    labs(title="Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999",
       x="",y="%",caption="Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")+
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())
```

According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01","2020-02-01"),

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.



# Challenge 2: GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

 The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.


```{r reshape_GDP_data}

#Pivot longer for the years and the values
tidy_GDP_data  <-  pivot_longer(UN_GDP_data,!CountryID & !Country & !IndicatorName, names_to="year",values_to="value") %>% 
  #Convert to bliion
  mutate(value=value/1e9)

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)


# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r plot GDP 3 countries, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
tidy_GDP_data2 <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>% 
  filter(year>=1970) 

#The names are creating problems, first pivot wider, then change the names of the columns, and then pivot longer again
tidy_GDP_names <-pivot_wider(tidy_GDP_data2,names_from=IndicatorName,values_from=value) %>% 
  rename("Exports"="Exports of goods and services") %>% 
  rename("Imports"="Imports of goods and services") %>% 
  rename("Household expenditure"="Household consumption expenditure (including Non-profit institutions serving households)") %>% 
  rename("Government expenditure"="General government final consumption expenditure") 

#Change the data into its long version for plotting
long_GDP_names <- pivot_longer(tidy_GDP_names, !CountryID & !Country & !year,names_to="Components_of_GDP",values_to="values")

#GGplot uses factors as levels, change the factor order for the order in legend
long_GDP_names2 <- long_GDP_names %>% 
  filter(Components_of_GDP %in% c("Gross capital formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports")) 
long_GDP_names2$Components_of_GDP<-factor(long_GDP_names2$Components_of_GDP,levels=c("Gross capital formation","Exports","Government expenditure","Household expenditure","Imports"))


long_GDP_names2 %>% 
  #Plot
  ggplot(aes(x=year))+
  geom_line(aes(y=values,group=Components_of_GDP,color=Components_of_GDP),size=1)+
  #For each country
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  theme_bw()+
  #Change x labels and add titles
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
  labs(title="GDP components over time",subtitle="In constant 2010 USD",x="",y="Billion US$")
```

Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.

> What is the % difference between what you calculated as GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?

```{r plot GDP 3 countries, fig.width=20, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}

perct_diff <- tidy_GDP_names %>% 
  rename("GDP"="Gross Domestic Product (GDP)") %>% 
  rename("G"="Government expenditure") %>% 
  rename("C"="Household expenditure") %>% 
  rename("I"="Gross capital formation") 
  #For each year and country, calculate the GDP and the difference

perct_diff2 <- perct_diff %>% 
  group_by(Country,year) %>% 
  summarize(GDP=GDP,GDP_calculated=C+I+G+Exports-Imports,difference=(GDP_calculated-GDP)/GDP)

perct_diff2 %>% 
  #For each the selected countries, summarize how far our GDP estimates are from the main estimates
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarize(avg_difference=(mean(difference)))
```

```{r gdp2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r plot GDP 3 countries, fig.width=10, fig.height=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
pro_GDP <- perct_diff %>% 
  #For each country & year
  group_by(Country,year) %>% 
  #Calculate components of gdp
  mutate("Government Expenditure"=G/GDP,"Gross capital formation"=I/GDP,"Household Expenditure"=C/GDP,"Net Exports"=(Exports-Imports)/GDP) %>% 
  select(Country,year,"Gross capital formation","Government Expenditure","Household Expenditure","Net Exports")

pro_GDP_long <- pivot_longer(pro_GDP,!Country & !year, names_to="categories",values_to="value")


pro_GDP_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year))+
  geom_line(aes(y=value,group=categories,color=categories),size=1)+
  facet_wrap(~Country)+
  theme_bw()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  scale_x_discrete(breaks=c(1970,1980,1990,2000,2010))+
  labs(title="GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars ",x="",y="proportion", caption="Source: United Nations, https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads")
```

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

For each country, the weight of different components seem to be roughly close, which reveal the similarity in economic structures of these 3 countries. Roughly, Household Expenditure keeps accounting for the largest proportion over the decades, Gross capital formation goes next and then the Government Expenditure. And the net exports is always the smallest part. 

However, there are varying trends for different components for different countries over the years. For example, the proportion of Household Expenditure in India keeps falling down for more than 10%, while that of Gross Capital formation has increased for more than 10%. The rest two parts, however, seem to be relatively stable. 

As for Germany, proportions of Household Expenditure and Gross Capital formation keep falling. Weight of Government Expenditure didn't change much while Net Exports largely increased to nearly 10% almost from zero.

And for United States, however, Household Expenditure on the contrary increased over decades although to a relatively small extent, while the proportion of Net exports stayed negative. And the biggest change would be that Gross Capital Formation surpassed Government Expenditure and became the second largest part.

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
