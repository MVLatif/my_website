description: I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg
  and Tim Burton are the same or not. I first defined the aesthetics and reordered
  in order to show  Steven Spielberg on top. Additionally, I added the mean point,
  error bars and confidence interval overlap to show that indeed the two directors
  have an. The error bars represent the standard error from the mean and how variable
  my data is. They give a rough idea of either how precise a measurement is, or how
  far from the reported value it might be. In this graph the fact that the 95% confidence
  interval overlap indicates that both sample sizes of IMDB ratings are equal or nearly
  equal, and that the P value is greater than 0.05. Thus, the difference between the
  two is not statistically significant.

# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/directors.png", error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. Then I ran a hypothesis test using both t.test and infer package to understand from a null distribution where I would assume zero difference between the two
In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}
# Select Tim Burton and Steven Spielberg and filter for director and rating
rating_analysis <- movies %>% filter(director == "Steven Spielberg" | director == "Tim Burton") %>% select(director, rating) %>% group_by(director)

# Calculate summary statistics
summary_stat <- rating_analysis %>%
  dplyr::summarize(
    mean_rating = mean(rating),
    sd_rating = sd(rating),
    count = n(),

    #Here calculate standard error SD/sqrt(n)
    se_rating = sd_rating/ sqrt(count),
    #Then calculate the t score
    t_critical = qt(0.95, df=4),
    #Calculate 95 prct
    lower = mean_rating - t_critical * se_rating,
    upper = mean_rating + t_critical * se_rating
  ) 
```

```{r}

# Create plot
summary_stat %>% 
  
  # Define aesthetics and reorder so that Steven Spielberh is shown on top
  ggplot(aes(x=mean_rating, y=reorder(director, mean_rating), xmin=lower,xmax=upper)) +
  
  # Add mean
  geom_point(color=c("orangered1", "turquoise4"), size=4) + 
  
  # Add error bars
  geom_errorbar(aes(xmin=lower,xmax=upper), color=c("orangered1", "turquoise4"), 
                size=1, width=0.1) +
  
  # Add labels to mean value
  geom_text(aes(label=round(mean_rating, digits=2)), size=5, vjust=-1.5)+
  
  # Add confidence interval overlap
  geom_rect(xmin=7.27, xmax= 7.33, ymin=-Inf, ymax=+Inf, alpha=0.2, fill="grey") +
  
  # Define Theme
  theme_bw()+
  
  #Add titles
  labs(title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB ratings?", 
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap",
       x="Mean IMDB Rating", y="Director")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 12))
```

```{r}
# Hypothesis test - H0: Tim Burton and Steven Spielberg films have the same mean 

# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for rating
library(infer)
set.seed(1234)

#Generate the samples and calculate variable of interest for Spielberg
boot_meanrating_Spielberg <- rating_analysis %>%
  filter(!is.na(rating) | director =="Steven Spielberg" ) %>% 
  #Specify variable of interest
  specify(response=rating) %>% 
  #Generate bootstrap samples
  generate(reps=n,type="bootstrap") %>% 
  #Calculate mean of each sample

#Generate the samples and calculate variable of interest for Burton
boot_meanrating_Burton <- rating_analysis %>%

  specify(response=rating) %>% 
  #Generate bootstrap samples
  generate(reps=n,type="bootstrap") %>% 
  #Calculate mean of each sample
  calculate(stat="mean")

# Calculation of standard error
 SE <- sqrt(((sd(boot_meanrating_Burton$stat)^2)/n)+((sd(boot_meanrating_Spielberg$stat)^2)/n))
 
# Calculation of t-score
 t_stat <- (mean(boot_meanrating_Burton$stat)-mean(boot_meanrating_Spielberg$stat))/SE
 print(t_stat)
